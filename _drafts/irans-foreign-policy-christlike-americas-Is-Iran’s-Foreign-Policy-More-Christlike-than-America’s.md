According to [polling](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/poiran2.html), a plurality of Americans believes that Iran is an irrational, suicide-bound regime that would use nuclear weapons on the US if it got the chance. But is this belief supported by Iran&#8217;s past actions?

If Iran is a violent and psychopathic nation relative to the United States, they should have a history of violence exceeding that of the United States.

## Jesus&#8217; Two Cents

&#8220;Turn the other cheek&#8221; is one of Jesus&#8217;s most famous catchphrases.  The phrase originates from the [Sermon on the Mount](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mount "Sermon on the Mount") in the New Testament. In the Sermon on the Mount in the [Gospel of Matthew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew"), Jesus says:

> <div>
>   You have heard that it was said, &#8216;An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.&#8217; But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

> </div>

In the [Sermon on the Plain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Plain "Sermon on the Plain") in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus says:

> <div>
>   27 ¶ But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the <em>one</em> cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not <em>to take thy</em> coat also. 30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask <em>them</em> not again. 31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
> </div>
> 
> <div>
>   —Luke 6:27-31. KJV
> </div>

The &#8220;Golden Rule&#8221; has been attributed to Jesus of Nazareth: &#8220;Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them&#8221; ([Matthew 7:12](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Matthew#7:12 "s:Bible (King James)/Matthew"), see also [Luke 6:31](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Luke#6:31 "s:Bible (King James)/Luke")). The common English phrasing is &#8220;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you&#8221;.

## America Predominantly Professes to Follow Jesus&#8217; Teachings

Most Americans are self-described Christians.

[<img title="american religious affiliation bar graph" src="http://thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/american-religious-affiliation-bar-graph.jpg" alt="" width="487" height="661" />](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States)

In 2000, about [0.4%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Iran)of Iran&#8217;s population were Christians.  Hence, you would expect the US to reflect the teachings of Jesus in it&#8217;s public policy to a much greater extent than Iran.

      <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655">Iran Air Flight 655</a></strong> was a civilian jet airliner shot down by U.S. missiles on July 3, 1988, over the Strait of Hormuz, toward the end of the Iran–Iraq War. The aircraft, an Airbus A300B2-203 operated by Iran Air, was flying from Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, over Iran&#8217;s territorial waters in the Persian Gulf on its usual flight path when it was destroyed by the United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS <em>Vincennes</em> (CG-49), killing all 290 passengers and crew aboard.  The U.S. government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives and in 1996 paid reparations to settle a suit brought in the International Court of Justice regarding the incident, however, the United States never released an apology or acknowledgment of wrongdoing. In August 1988 <em><a title="Newsweek" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek">Newsweek</a></em> quoted Vice President George H. W. Bush as saying &#8220;I&#8217;ll never apologize for the United States of America. Ever. I don&#8217;t care what the facts are.&#8221;

  <h2>
    Timeline of US-Iran Relations
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    1953 &#8211; Under orders from President Eisenhower, the CIA organized a military coup that overthrew Iran&#8217;s democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh.  Britain, unhappy that Iran nationalized its oil industry, came up with the idea for the coup and pressed the United States to mount a joint operation to remove Mossadeqh.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1953 to 1979 &#8211; Following the coup, the U.S installed Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi , and the thriving democracy that existed in Iran was crushed.  The Shah led 25 years of tyrannical rule (supported by the CIA) that resulted in the killing of thousands of Iranians who opposed the U.S. puppet government.  On the economic front, the Shah denationalized Iran’s oil industry, 60% of which went to American firms.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1979 U.S.-backed Shah of Iran forced to leave the country after widespread demonstrations and strikes. Islamic religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini returns from exile and takes effective power.  Sixty-six hostages taken by students at the U.S. embassy in Tehran.  The students justified taking the hostages as retaliation for the admission of the Shah into the U.S., and demanded the Shah be returned to Iran for a trial. The new Iranian regime believed the Shah was in the U.S. so that the U.S. could carry out another coup d&#8217;etat in Iran; the U.S. claimed he had come there only to seek medical attention. The Shah was given refuge and Iranians demanded his extradition to Iran to face justice.  The U.S. rejected Iran&#8217;s request and the hostage taking ensued. The hostage crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran lasted 444 days
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1980 &#8211; Iraq invades neighboring Iran with the approval of the United States.  The war lasts eight years and kills hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Iranians.  Iran suffered heavy casualties from Saddam&#8217;s chemical weapons, many of which were provided by the U.S.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1981 &#8211; Last 52 U.S. hostages freed in January after intense diplomatic activity. Their release comes a few hours after U.S. President Jimmy Carter leaves office. They had been held for 444 days.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1982 to 1983 &#8211; As Iranian forces gained the upper hand on the battlefield with Iraq, the U.S. launched another covert operation to arm and aid Saddam.  It began clandestinely to supply Saddam with satellite intelligence on Iran&#8217;s deployments.  Weapons were also sent via CIA fronts in Chile and Saudi Arabia directly to Baghdad.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Between 1986 and 1989, some seventy-three transactions took place that included bacterial cultures to make weapons-grade anthrax, advanced computers, and equipment to repair jet engines and rockets.  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein greets Donald Rumsfeld, then special envoy of President Ronald Reagan, in Baghdad on December 20, 1983.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1985 to 1986 &#8211; Iran-Contra Affair: U.S. holds secret talks with Iran and makes weapons shipments, allegedly in exchange for Iranian assistance in releasing U.S. hostages in Lebanon. With revelations that profits were illegally channeled to Nicaraguan rebels, this creates the biggest crisis of Ronald Reagan&#8217;s presidency.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1987 &#8211; Following the mining of a U.S. Navy frigate, U.S. forces engage in series of encounters with Iranian naval forces, including strikes on Gulf oil platforms. The engagement was code named &#8220;Operation Praying Mantis&#8221;.  The battle, the largest between surface forces since World War II, sank two Iranian warships and as many as six armed speedboats.  The Iranian Frigate, IS Alvand, attacked by U.S. Navy forces
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1988 &#8211; On patrol in the Persian Gulf, the USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian passenger jet that it had mistaken for a hostile Iranian fighter aircraft. U.S. Navy Captain Will C. Rogers III ordered a single missile fired from his warship, which hit its target and killed all 290 people aboard the commercial Airbus.
