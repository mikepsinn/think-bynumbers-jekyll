Political Labels = Intellectual Prisons
Political labels only serve to divide us and pit us against each other even though we all really share the same fundamental goal that drives our civic life and action.  We all want to solve all the world’s problems.

So first, we must define what a problem is. A problem is a matter or situation that causes harm.  All humans generally want to minimize harm, don’t they?  (Notable exceptions include Skeletor from He-Man and that jerk with the mustache who’s always tying ladies to railroad tracks in old movies.)

Beneath all the politics, the basic objective of everyone is ultimately to minimize the amount of suffering in the world. There are 3 steps that must be performed in order to accomplish this shared imperative of minimizing suffering.

Solve All the World’s Problems in 3 Easy Steps!
The Abolitionist Project, originally conceived by utilitarian philosopher, David Pearce, has the modest goal of eliminating all unnecessary suffering on earth. It’s done in three easy steps! These 3 steps are as follows:

Step 1: Learn
Identifying and thoroughly understanding the details of the problems reducing the net happiness of the world is the necessary first step to solving them.  We all need to work together to find the truth (i.e. facts and statistics) about every issue.

I know (from personal experience) that it’s easy to feel like you know enough about a political issue to have a strong opinion on it.  But I assure you that you don’t know what you don’t know. I certainly know that I don’t know what I don’t know, don’t you know?

OBSTACLE = TRIBALISM
Human nature is the primary obstacle to completion of step one. The vast majority political discourse consists predominantly of the vestigial remains of tribal warfare. But today’s tribes are those of left/right/libertarian ideology. Throughout our evolutionary history, characterized by scarcity of resources, the greatest threats to propagating your genes were other humans outside your familial or tribal group.  In such an environment, those with the instinctual urge to engage in tribal warfare were the most likely to attain the resources necessary to survive.

Allowing disagreement about solutions arising from dogma instead of data leads to poisonous and paralyzing animosity. Arguing about solutions before we’ve even arrived at the basic truths underlying issues is a recipe for a dead world.

HOW TO OVERCOME THIS OBSTACLE = THINK BY NUMBERS
Our cognitive flaws can be overcome by using our prefrontal cortices to focus on hard facts and think by numbers.  The intent of this site is pull everyone out of their distorted and dogmatic political worlds. Once we’re all in the same reality and everyone understands the underlying truths of the issues, we can finally move on to step two and get some Goddamn work done.

THE FUTURE OF THINKBYNUMBERS.ORG
We are currently working on the creation of a much more advanced version of this site aimed at harnessing the power of crowd-sourcing and gamification to build a massive repository of public policy data in an easy to consume format. This basically means turning the site into a crowd-sourced citizen education platform. You can contribu

THE WISDOM OF CROWDS
On the new site, anyone will be able to join and submit data-based articles.  All articles will have an automatically created wiki sister version that anyone can edit or add to.

The beauty of the wiki system is its ability to aggregate massive amounts of accurate data.  The flaw of the wiki is that mixing up the thoughts of lots of people is like mixing up a lot of different colors of paint. Vivid colors and interpretations are diluted eventually produces bland brown or gray copy.

HOW TO OBTAIN EYEBALLS
It would be ideal if humans could just come to our site and look at spreadsheets and graphs full of objective data, absorb the data, and use it to inform their opinions. Unfortunately, human brains are wired such that they require some degree of subjective analysis to activate their neural reward systems. So the original author will retain full editorial control over their version allowing them to use the literary tools such as satire to make the data palatable to the unwashed masses.

Preservation of satire is also important because it can sometimes prevent activation of the sympathetic stress response if the reader sees something that contradicts their current views (this disables the prefrontal cortex inhibiting rational analysis and receptiveness to new data).

GAMIFICATION AS A MOTIVATIONAL TOOL
Gamification is another means of working within the constraints of the kluge known as the human brain.  A point system will be used to incentivize contributors to maximize the objectivity, information density, and entertaining nature of their submissions.

Each article will be scored using an algorithm that considers the number of unique hyperlinks to sources in an article, the quality of the sources, the number of images, the number of hyperlinked statistics, and user ratings.  The articles will be sorted on the site from the highest scores to the lowest scores. This friendly competition for the top position among authors will hopefully incentivize them to produce their best work.

This sorting system has the added benefit of allowing the best content to float to the top, while the crummy content sinks out of sight. This is critical function when crowdsourcing content, because the freedom given to contributors opens up the door to a lot of spam and garbage being submitted that we don’t want to drown out the good quality content.

VOTE!
I encourage everyone to use the voting system to vote up comments containing facts with sources. I also encourage everyone to vote down ad hominem attacks directed at anyone.  We all share the same goal of minimizing the amount of suffering in the world.  Name-calling is completely unproductive.  Ad hominem attacks cause to the emotional limbic system to steal the cognitive reins from our rational pre-frontal cortices.  This process makes primates out of philosophers.

Step 2: Decide
Identify the Most Effective Solutions
Next we brainstorm to come up as many potential solutions as possible. Figuring out which solution is best is the hard part. Ideally, we would use the scientific method to conduct experiments by:

Implementing an experimental public policy change (independent variable) in one “experimental society” which is hypothesized to reduce the level of suffering in the society.
Allow some time to pass until the resultant societal impact (dependent variable) from the experimental public policy change (independent variable) has stabilized.
Measure the degree of suffering (dependent variable) in this “experimental society” through some sort of Gross National Happiness index.
Measure the degree of suffering (dependent variable) in a “control society”. The “control society would be identical to the “experimental society” in every way aside from the absence of the experimental public policy change (independent variable).
OBSTACLE = WE DON’T HAVE A CONTROL SOCIETY
Unfortunately, the scientific method would require an identical control society in which the experimental policy is not implemented. There’s no way to limit experimental variables to just one.  In the real world there are an infinite number of independent variables influencing the outcome of your experiment. This makes it rather impossible. You can partially overcome this by implementing experimental public policy in some states and comparing to the average outcome to the same metric averaged from the states which have not implemented this experimental policy.  However, there are so many other random variables that you need a very large number of states so that the random variations cancel each other out.

HOW TO OVERCOME THIS OBSTACLE
Decide which problems cause the most suffering and which solutions are most cost effective. This was not previously something that could be quantified due to their inherent complexity. However, there is a new tool call crowd-sourcing which could be used to facilitate this. Two examples of effective crowd-sourcing provided by James Suroweki in The Wisdom of Crowds were guessing the weight of an ox and finding a missing submarine.

Cost-effectiveness calculations will be accomplished using an online database where users can see a list of all the major problems in the world. A problem is just an issue or situation that causes suffering. The user can then submit their estimations of the magnitude of the suffering (either using a dollar figure or a unit of pleasure called a util or hedon) caused by each major world problem using the Jeremy Bentham’s Felicific Calculus. All submissions are then averaged and problems are ranked according to the degree of suffering caused by each.  There are many potential pitfalls to crowdsourcing, primarily evidenced by our electoral system.  However, all of these problems can be overcome using advanced statistical methods.

Users can also submit ideas for possible solutions. Then everyone can submit their estimates on how much each solution will cost and how much suffering it will reduce. Then the amount of suffering eliminated divided by the cost of the solution will give you a value representative of the cost-effectiveness of that solution. This step is known as the Crowdsourcing Utopia Project.

STEP 3: ACT
In the final step, a charitable foundation will acquire and direct resources towards realizing the most cost effective solutions. This might be called the Charitable Foundation for the Abolition of Suffering. It is hoped that this will take over many functions that government is currently supposed to be fulfilling, but is not due to incompetence and/or corruption.

INITIAL FUNDING

In order to fund the Abolitionist Project, we are creating QuantiModo.  A platform that will facilitate citizen scientists to combine, visualize, and analyze life-tracking data from a variety of apps and devices.  This will allows individuals to improve their lives (reducing suffering on a microscale) by identifying the factors that most influence their health and well-being. It will also benefit humanity on a macro-scale in that it will allow users to anonymously donate their data which will be used to crowd-source cures for many types of mental and physical illnesses.
