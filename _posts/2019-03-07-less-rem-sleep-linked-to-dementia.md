    href="https://www.livescience.com/60216-decreased-rem-sleep-dementia-risk.html">17</a> percent of their sleep time
  in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage<a href="https://www.livescience.com/59300-brain-cells-linked-to-dreaming-found.html"

    href="https://www.livescience.com/60216-decreased-rem-sleep-dementia-risk.html">20</a> percent for those who did not
